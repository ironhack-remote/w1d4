// We have 4 exercises to do:
// STEP 1

// You were asked to submit a list of all the brands
// you currently have in your stand! How could you do that?

// STEP 2

// We want to advertise all the cars below 15.000€ to the public
// Can you deliver a list of all of the cars that meet that requirement?

// STEP 3

// We want to know how much our total collection of cars is worth!
// To do that, we have to sum all of the car values.
// How could we do that?

// STEP 4

// You were asked to deliver a list of the cars
// but from the least expensive to the most expensive one!
// How could you --sort-- the array to achieve that?
